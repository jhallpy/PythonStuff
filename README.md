# PythonStuff
This repo will include little projects that I'm working on in order to learn Python better. In the future I will add new repos for larger projects that I have planned.

# Using these programs.
I have added a requirements.txt file. You can add the required libraries by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This should allow you to run any program in this repo. Put `requirements.txt` in the directory where the command will be executed. If it is in another directory, specify the path.
